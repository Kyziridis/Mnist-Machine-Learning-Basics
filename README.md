# Mnist-Machine-Learning-Basics
Various methods for image classification of handwritten numbers.

Run the Main.py first, and then if you want to see some plots run Plots.py

Dependencies for Main.py: numpy , matplotlib , sklearn, collections, itertools.

Dependencies for Plots.py: networkx , matplotlib, scipy, graphviz, pygraphviz

For Plots.py: Load and run Main.py first (better in Spyder or another python-IDE) and then run Plots.py
